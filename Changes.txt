Changelog for t38modem 3.14.0 (Mar 3 2016)
--- Requires Opal 3.10.14 / Ptlib 2.10.14
* Additional debug on SIP Registration.
* New option: --sip-retry-403-forbidden
  UNIFY systems will respond 403 Forbidden when resetting to apply new
  settings. RFC 3261 says this is a final answer and the request should
  not be retried. UNIFY says that is the way they work and you have to 
  retry. This violates ithe RFC, but is needed to make UNIFY work.
* Added ability to use the all of the Fake Codecs:
    G.722, G.722.1, G.722.2, G.726-40K, G.726-32K, G.726-24K, G.726-16K,
    G.728, G.729, G.729A, G.729B, G.729A/B, G.723.1, G.723.1(5.3k),

  Specify with --fake-audio option and --sip-audio or --h323-audio options.  

Changelog for t38modem 3.13.0 (Aug 10 2015)

  number 32768 instead of the required 0 in UDPTL T.38 packets.
